Create a spring boot project in this folder. Use maven to build it. We need 3 URIs:
1. "/login" Users can use this URI to authenticate themselves. The input is in JSON format and the output is also in JSON format
2. "/create_user" Users can use this URI to registrate a new user in the system. They need to provide a username, an email and a password for the registration to work.
3. "/authtest" If the user has been previously successfully authenticated return a JSON response indicating everything is ok. Otherwise give a response showing them the login URI.
Use Spring Security to implement everything authentication and user creation related. Also make sure the stored passwords are encrypted and salted. All new users must be created with the standard role. We will create admin registration some other time. We will be using the PostgreSQL dialect to talk to the database. The database itself is located at localhost:5432, username="warlord", password="dragonslayer". Database name to connect to is astendor. You should be able to access tables users, roles and user_roles. These should be enough to create this functionality. Once the code is written use maven to build it and test it by trying to create the following user: {"username":"Dean", "password":"winchester81", "email":"dean@hunting.com"}, authenticate that user and test "/authtest" URI too. If everything is successful keep that user in the database.
